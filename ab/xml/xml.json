protected him from harm, bringing him food, comfort - and friendship.<br /> In their brief time together, Emery and Roman forged a deep bond, but the authorities wasted no time tracking Roman down and capturing him in a violent confrontation.<br /> Emery has grown up believing that Roman was killed that day.<br /> Ten years later, the Atrians have been acclimated to life on Earth, but they are

are the next evolutionary leap of mankind, a generation of humans born with paranormal abilities - the Tomorrow People.<br /> Stephen Jameson stands at the crossroads between the world we know and the shifting world of the future.<br /> Up until a year ago, Stephen was a \"normal\" teenager - until he began hearing voices and teleporting in his sleep, never knowing where he might wake up.<br /> Now, Stephen's issues have gone far beyond the usual teenage angst, and he is beginning to question his sanity.<br /> In desperation, Stephen decides to listen to one of the voices in his head, and it leads him to his first encounter with the Tomorrow People - John, Cara and Russell - a genetically advanced race with the abilities of telekinesis, teleportation and telepathic communication.<br /> The Tomorrow People are being hunted down by a paramilitary group of scientists known as Ultra.<br /> Led by Dr.<br /> Jedikiah Price, Ultra sees the Tomorrow People as a very real existential threat from a rival species, and the outcast group has been forced to hide out in an abandoned subway station just beneath the surface of the human world.<br /> Trading in secrets, Jedikiah offers Stephen the chance for a normal life with his family and best friend, Astrid, if he will help in the struggle to isolate and eradicate the Tomorrow People.<br /> On the other hand, Cara, John and Russell offer Stephen a different type of family and a home where he truly belongs.<br /> Unwilling to turn his back on humanity or the world of the Tomorrow People, Stephen sets out on his own path - a journey that could take him into the shadowy past to uncover the truth about his father's mysterious disappearance, or into an unknown future with THE TOMORROW
