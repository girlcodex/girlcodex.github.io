In Catelyn's first POV chapter at the beginning of the first book, she even pointed out how painful it was that Jon Snow actually looks more like his \"father\" Ned than her own son Robb Stark. Arya was the only one of their children to inherit dark Stark features, and Ned said she looked like her aunt Lyanna when she was young - which could have been a hint that just as Arya took after her aunt in appearance, Jon took after his uncle, not his real father, in appearance.

Thus while a rift seems to be developing between Jon and Sansa about which of them should rule the North - Sansa the trueborn daughter or Jon the male bastard - Bran's revelation of Jon's parentage when he returns south may render this contention moot. Sansa wouldn't resent Bran ruling ahead of her, because he was always ahead of her in line of succession as a trueborn son.

The problem is that their fleets are still tied up besieging Stannis's remaining garrison at Dragonstone island. Realizing he needs to force a quick end to the siege at Dragonstone to save his homeland, Loras boldly volunteers to Cersei that he will lead the assault. Cersei is only too happy to agree, knowing full well that it will be a bloodbath and she hopes he gets killed. Loras's performance in the ensuing battle at Dragonstone leaves many in awe, as he fought like the Warrior himself. Towards the end, however, Loras became badly wounded and trapped under an archway from which the enemy poured boiling oil on him. Loras was horrifically burned over most of his body and not expected to live. On the other hand, by the end of the fifth novel, Loras has stubbornly managed to cling to life - barely - against all odds and all predictions of the maesters, so it is not clear if he will pull through.

              "text": "As clarified in the \"Inside the Episode\" featurette, there is some growing tension between Jon and Sansa about who will rule the North: Sansa is a trueborn daughter and thus by rights should rank ahead of a bastard son like Jon. Moreover, Jon makes it clear that he doesn't even want to rule the North and expects Sansa to be Lady of Winterfell. Unfortunately, their assembled bannermen then spontaneously declare Jon their new king because they were impressed by his bravery on the battlefield personally fighting the Boltons; thus through no intention of his own, Jon ends up usurping Sansa's right to rule the North. In an ironic twist, it was Lyanna Mormont, a female ruler, who first declared Jon to be King in the North, as well as rally the other lords to declare Jon King in the North. The rift between Jon and Sansa is very subtly shown in the scene where Jon is declared king. When Lyanna Mormont states that she knows \"No king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark', Sansa is smiling. This could be because she believes Lyanna is about to declare her, Eddard Stark's trueborn daughter, Queen in the North. However, when Lyanna then says \"I don't care if he's a bastard.\" the smile quickly fades from Sansa's face, as she realizes that Lyanna is referring to Jon, not her. She smiles again afterward because she is happy for her brother, but the smile fades once more when she sees Littlefinger, who is smirking knowingly due to their earlier meeting where he brought up that Sansa should be the North's future, not Jon.",

Under the rules of heraldry in Westeros, bastard sons can't use the heraldry of their trueborn family, so they often use the same image with the color scheme reversed: i.e. the Targaryen sigil is a red dragon on a black background, so their bastard offshoot House Blackfyre used a black dragon on a red background as their sigil. House Stark's heraldry is a grey direwolf on a snow white background, thus Stark bastards in past generations have frequently used a white wolf on a grey background for their heraldry. Thus Jon would use a white wolf as a heraldic symbol of his status as a bastard of House Stark. This is one of the reasons they saw it as a sign from the Old Gods when they found a dead direwolf with exactly six pups, one for each Stark child, even in the right gender ratio - the sixth pup was even an albino, to match Jon's bastard status.",

It is unclear of this was intentional but in this episode, when Arya is wearing her shapeshifter mask to look like a serving girl (and is played by a different actress), she clearly pronounces \"my lord\" as two separate words when she speaks, the way a highborn does - perhaps a subtle hint early on that the serving girl wasn't what she seemed.",

Arianne then asks him what he means, at which he quotes the Targaryen motto \"Fire and Blood\" - these lines were shifted to Varys in the TV version. In the novels, Ellaria is actually against the idea of going to war with the Lannisters, fearing she may lose more family members, while Arianne and the Sand Snakes push for war, but in ways that do not involve harming Myrcella, as she is innocent of any crime. The television series has essentially swapped Doran's and Ellaria's roles, depicting them and the Sand Snakes in a substantially more negative light than in the novels, since Doran is portrayed as a somewhat ineffective ruler with no intention of avenging his sister at least, while Ellaria and the Sand Snakes are depicted as willing to murder innocent people to get what they want, to the point that the Sand Snakes appear to enjoy killing or tormenting people just for the fun of it, and Ellaria, apparently maddened by her desire to avenge Oberyn, is willing to murder Oberyn's own brother and nephew in the process.",

During the Conquest of Dorne, the young King Daeron I Targaryen managed to subdue the Martells through a brilliant military campaign, but this was followed by a bitter Dornish insurgency which costs many thousands more men due to attrition. Daeron I left Lord Lyonel Tyrell behind as governor of occupied Dorne, but the Dornish so hated his rule that one day they laid a trap which dumped over a hundred poisonous scorpions onto his bed, killing him.",

It was a simmering cultural resentment but didn't affect their major actions. The TV show removed much of this from when Oberyn Martell appears in King's Landing in Season 4 because due to time limitations they wanted to focus on the far more prominent Martell-Lannister rivalry. Nonetheless, this explains some of Olenna's brusk attitude towards Ellaria and the Sand Snakes: the Dornish have very relaxed attitudes about bastardy but the Reachmen do not, and all of them are bastards. On top of that, in the books, Olenna looked down on Ellaria for being Oberyn's unmarried paramour, which she bluntly felt meant Ellaria was a whore. Of course, in the TV version, Olenna is more immediately upset that Ellaria and the Sand Snakes murdered Prince Doran and his son, an act of betrayal and kinslaying.",

Kevan later arrives in the room and Varys shoots him with a crossbow, mortally wounding him. Varys then apologizes to Kevan that he's a good man who happens to be supporting the wrong side and he bears him no ill will. He explains that Kevan and Pycelle were doing too good of a job of undoing the damage which Cersei had caused the Lannister faction - and not only is he removing them, but he will frame their deaths on the Tyrells, further driving a wedge between Cersei and her few potential remaining allies. Varys then has his little birds come in and finish off the wounded Kevan. The TV version shifted this around so that Kevan dies in the Great Sept, while Pycelle gets more or less the same death he did in the book version - but in this case ordered by Varys's replacement Qyburn, and ultimately Cersei. It does make sense that Cersei would kill Pycelle in a purge, given that even he abandoned her and brought Kevan back to King's Landing to rule after he realized that Cersei's inept leadership was running the crown into the ground.
