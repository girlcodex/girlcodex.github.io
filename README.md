what's important?

index.htm
js/scripts.js
css/styles.css

other parts:
/ab an api access test (with a broken api hook - )
/port is my graphic design portfolio (that show some fun css tricks)
/ph is a website I created and then translated to an Android app 
/graphReact isn't uploaded in the initial commit, it gets merged in as i translate the site to react.

the initial commit is buggy, but diffing it against more current commits shows how i fix those problems.

its a messy playground at first, but i've done that purposefully, so you can see how i solve problems.


edit: 11/15 updated GraphReact-build and GraphReactDemo
  ^^^ this should be a better demo
